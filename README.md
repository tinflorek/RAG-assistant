# RAG Assistant

A small, fully local **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** service. Upload documents
(PDF / Markdown / text), and ask questions that are answered **grounded in those
documents**, with inline source citations. Everything runs on your machine — no
external APIs. Embeddings and the LLM are served by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/),
vectors are stored in [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), and the HTTP layer is
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## How it works

```
          ┌──────────── ingest ────────────┐         ┌──────────── query ───────────┐
 PDF/MD/TXT → chunk (512/50) → embed ──────►  Chroma  ◄──── embed(question) ── retrieve top-3
                              (nomic-embed-text)  │                                  │
                                                  └──── chunks ──► LLM (qwen2.5:3b) ─┘
                                                                   → answer + citations
```

1. **Ingest** — a document is loaded, split into ~512-character chunks (50-char
   overlap), embedded with `nomic-embed-text`, and stored in a Chroma collection
   named `documents` (cosine similarity).
2. **Query** — the question is embedded, the top 3 most similar chunks are
   retrieved, and `qwen2.5:3b` answers using only that context, citing sources as
   `[filename, chunk N]`.

## API

| Method | Path      | Description                                                        |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`                    | Web UI — upload documents, ask questions, manage indexed docs    |
| GET    | `/health`              | Liveness check → `{"status": "ok"}`                              |
| POST   | `/ingest`              | Upload a `.pdf` / `.md` / `.txt` file (multipart) and index it. Re-uploading an already-indexed filename returns **409** — delete it first |
| GET    | `/documents`           | List indexed documents → `[{"source": ..., "chunks": N}, ...]`   |
| DELETE | `/documents/{filename}`| Remove a document — deletes its chunks **and** the uploaded file from `docs/` (404 if not indexed) |
| POST   | `/query`               | Body `{"question": "..."}` → `{"answer": ..., "sources": [...]}`. Chunks below the similarity floor are dropped; if none qualify, the answer says so and `sources` is empty |

A browser UI is served at `/` (the simplest way to use the app), and interactive
API docs are at `/docs` (Swagger) once the API is running.

## Running with Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Start the whole stack — that's it.
docker compose up -d --build
```

On first run the `ollama-init` service automatically pulls both models before the
API starts, so no manual `ollama pull` is needed. Then **open
<http://localhost:8080> in your browser** to upload documents and ask questions.

Prefer the command line? The same endpoints are on host port 8080:

```bash
curl -F "file=@docs/test.pdf" http://localhost:8080/ingest
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is this document about?"}'
```

> The first run downloads ~2 GB of models; they live in the `ollama_data` named
> volume, so later starts are fast and need no re-pull. Use `docker compose down`
> to stop; avoid `down -v`, which **wipes the volumes** (models and the vector
> store).

## Running locally (without Docker)

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a running Ollama with both models
pulled (`ollama pull nomic-embed-text && ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`).

```bash
# Install dependencies into a project venv
uv sync

# Start a local Chroma server (separate terminal)
uv run chroma run --host localhost --port 8000 --path ./chroma_data

# Ingest a document (scripts run from the app/ directory)
cd app && uv run python ingest.py            # ingests ../docs/test.pdf

# Ask a question from the CLI
uv run python query.py "What is RAG?"

# Or run the API
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload             # http://localhost:8000
```

> When running the API locally, set `DOCS_DIR` to a real path (it defaults to the
> container path `/app/docs`), e.g. `DOCS_DIR=../docs uv run uvicorn main:app`.

## Configuration

The scripts read these environment variables (with host-friendly defaults), so the
same code works both locally and inside the compose network:

| Variable      | Default     | Purpose                          |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `CHROMA_HOST` | `localhost` | Chroma server host               |
| `CHROMA_PORT` | `8000`      | Chroma server port               |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | `localhost` | Ollama host                      |
| `OLLAMA_PORT` | `11434`     | Ollama port                      |
| `DOCS_DIR`    | `/app/docs` | Where uploaded files are written |
| `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | `0.4` | Minimum cosine similarity for a retrieved chunk to be used as context |

## Notes

- **Chroma is pinned to `0.6.3`** to match the Python client. A newer server image
  breaks the `0.6.3` client (`KeyError: '_type'`).
- The collection uses **cosine** similarity, so `query.py` reports a similarity
  score in `[0, 1]` (computed as `1 - cosine_distance`).
- Chroma is **not** exposed on the host — only `rag-api` reaches it, over the
  internal compose network as `chromadb:8000`. Keeping the vector store
  network-internal avoids unnecessary attack surface. (For one-off debugging you
  can publish it via a `docker-compose.override.yml` rather than the base file.)
